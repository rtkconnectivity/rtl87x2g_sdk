 *          There are many ways to exchange data between tasks, for example using shared

 *          Many resources can be considered as serially-reusable. This means that they

/**
 *
 * \brief   Create a counting semaphore.
 *
 * \details Semaphores are used to manage and protect access to shared resources. A semaphore
 *          can be used to permit a fixed number of tasks to access a pool of shared resources.
 *
 *          A semaphore object should be initialized to the maximum number of available tokens.
 *          This number of available resources is specified as a parameter of the os_sem_create()
 *          function. Each time a semaphore token is obtained with os_sem_take(), the semaphore
 *          count is decremented. When the semaphore count is 0, no semaphore token can be obtained.
 *          The task that tries to obtain the semaphore token needs to wait until the next token
 *          is free. Semaphores are released with os_sem_give(), incrementing the semaphore count.
