 *
 * \brief   Create and control software timer and timer callback functions.
 * \details The Timer Management function group allows creating, deleting, and controlling software
 *          timers in the system. The software timers can be configured as one-shot or periodic
 *          timers. When a timer expires, a callback function associated with the timer is
 *          executed.\n
 * Timers can be in the following two states:\n
 * \arg <b>Dormant</b> The timer first enters <b>Dormant</b> or <b>Inactive</b> state when created.
 *                     If a one-shot timer expires but is not restarted yet, or is stopped, the timer
 *                     will be transformed from <b>Active</b> state into <b>Dormant</b> state.
 * \arg <b>Active</b> The timer enters <b>Active</b> state if the timer starts or restarts. When
 *                    expired, the callback function associated with the timer will be executed.
