User Data 
======

User Data Tool converts the original APP Data bin file into APP Data type image that can be burned into External Flash by RTL87x2G MP Tool.
After User Data Tool processes, it will add a 1280 bytes image header and 512 bytes MP header in front of the original User data, which are used for Bootloader check and MPTool burning respectively. 
Assuming that the size of the bin file of the original User Data is 120KB, the final burn to the flash will be 1280 bytes image header plus 120KB User data payload.
